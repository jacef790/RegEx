# Regex. How and Why.

A regular expression (RegEx) are a sequence of characters used to find matching character combinations in text. The MDN web docs describe it as, "Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String."("Regular expressions," 2021).
